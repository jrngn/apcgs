# APCGS

APCGS stands for Abstract Procedural Content Generation Suite - in other words, it is meant to be a set of tools for building PCG tools.

It began initialy as a simple woldgen and editor, but it quickly outgrew its scope.
Now its purpose is to serve as a set of generic solutions for more tedious or complex tasks for a variety of end products.

Currently consists of 4 subprojects:

- LexMachina, a generalized system for lexing, parsing and compiling user defined languages
- GUIGEE, a renderer-agnostic GUI system that began as HTML Flexbox container reimplementation
- Patternizr, an N-dimensional discrete space processor (or in simpler terms a CPU-based shader-esque system meant for data generation)
- Terran Protocol, an entirely query-based feature distribution system

DISCLAIMER: This solution is a rework and consolidation of multiple separate projects, under active developement.
Most of the code is currently publicly unavailable, waiting to be redesigned and refactored.
